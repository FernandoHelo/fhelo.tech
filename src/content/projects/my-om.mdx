My OM Assistant is a cutting-edge voice assistant designed to monitor and understand the state of buildings. It integrates seamlessly with a Digital Twin, providing a 3D and AR visualization of the building.

This project runs on a local Linux server, which hosts both the voice assistant and the Digital Twin. The voice assistant is developed using Python, while the Digital Twin leverages Three.js for 3D rendering.

The voice assistant connects with Home Assistant and OpenAI to deliver a personalized experience for monitoring and controlling the building environment.

Utilizing Langchain, the voice assistant can chain multiple prompts to generate appropriate responses by gathering information from various APIs, including Home Assistant, Google Calendar, Google Tasks, search, a Python REPL, a calculator, and Wolfram Alpha.
