Spumma is an integrated management and administration system for laundromats, designed to facilitate operations and service sales. It uses IoT technology to control and monitor Dexter brand washers and dryers.

Incorporates inventory management for offered products, allowing detailed control of items such as detergents, fabric softeners, bottled water, etc. This feature enables stock management and helps prevent shortages or overstock.

It also includes a transaction history and reporting feature, allowing administrators to access a complete record of all sales and services provided. This allows for customer analysis and assists with accounting.

Spumma has a membership system that manages customer's balances for using the services. Customers acquire an RFID card to identify themselves and use the laundry equipment in a self-service manner. This is possible because the memberships also allow the activation of the equipment for use, considering the remaining balance.

Spumma includes a point of sale (POS) to serve customers and facilitate the sale of laundry services, as well as the sale of memberships, balance recharges, and products.
